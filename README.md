#Exploring Delphi Again
A long time ago, I used to be a Delphi programmer. However, I transitioned to the infrastructure field and completely left programming behind. After 16 years away from development, I decided to return to coding and rediscover my passion.
As a practical exercise, I decided to create a cataloging project for my music collection.
I acknowledge that both the programming style and the project interfaces are quite basic. Therefore, Iâ€™d be immensely grateful for any suggestions or help to improve the code, design, or functionality. This is a learning project, and all contributions are welcome!
